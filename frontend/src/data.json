That doesn't mean he'll play in an exhibition, but we could see a return to full-team drills as soon as next week, once the Giants resume practicing after Sunday's preseason tilt in Cleveland. Former teammate Odell Beckham seems to be a step ahead of Barkley in the ACL rehab process, though the wideout still figures to miss Sunday's reunion.",

But Penny has appeared in just three games since tearing his ACL in December 2019 (all at the end of last season) before sitting out the Seahawks' wild-card loss to the Rams due to a knee issue. He subsequently underwent a cleanup procedure on his knee in the offseason and has missed more than a week of practice recently with a thigh concern. Penny will need to get on the field soon to play Saturday, but even if he doesn't he'll have one more exhibition Saturday, Aug. 28 versus the Chargers to prove he should be the No. 2 RB in Seattle. Travis Homer (calf), probably Penny's primary competitor, is on the PUP list, leaving DeeJay Dallas, Alex Collins and Josh Johnson to vie for slotting in this positional group.",

That all changed Thursday when he underwent the procedure. If the timeline to return is correct, Bateman seems to be a long shot to suit up Week 1 against the Saints, considering that game is four-and-a-half weeks in the future. More accurately, he may not see his first NFL action until late September or even October. The Ravens have a number of injured wide receivers at the moment, with Marquise Brown and Miles Boykin tending to hamstring issues. With the trio sidelined, Sammy Watkins, Devin Duvernay, Tylan Wallace and James Proche are the notable healthy members of the positional group.",

His one preseason appearance figures to be brief, with the 25-year-old coming back from an ACL tear and already locked in for a starting job. Sutton and Jerry Jeudy are the favorites to lead Denver in targets this year, but the team has plenty of other mouths to feed, including TE Noah Fant, WRs KJ Hamler and Tim Patrick and RBs Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams. The offensive line also looks solid, while Drew Lock and Teddy Bridgewater are said to be neck and neck for the starting assignment at quarterback.",

He thus sat out New Orleans' exhibition opener Saturday, but now that he's on the field again he could set himself up to play in Monday's game versus the Jaguars. First, though, Smith may have to get his feet back under him and his conditioning up to par.",

While he did some straight-line running at Giants Fan Fest on Aug. 11 and caught passes from a Jugs machine Tuesday, he was contained to work with trainers on the side during Thursday's joint practice with the Browns, per Rosenblatt, and won't take part in any drills Friday, either, coach Joe Judge told Paul Schwartz of the New York Post. If Golladay indeed takes a seat this weekend, he'll have just one more opportunity to make his Giants debut in the exhibition slate Sunday, Aug. 29 versus the Patriots.",

Washington activated the 25-year-old from the PUP list Sunday, potentially allowing for an appearance in the preseason finale Aug. 28 against Baltimore. With Samuel out for the exhibition opener last week, Cam Sims reprised his role from the second half of last season as the No. 2 receiver. It figures to be a much-higher-volume role now that Samuel and his three-year, $34.5 million contract are filling it.",
